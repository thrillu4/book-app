# 📚 Book App

A simple yet functional book browsing website built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **TypeScript**, and other modern technologies.  
This project was created as a **learning exercise** to practice working with state management, API integration, routing, and component-based architecture in a real-world scenario.

Users can search for books, filter them by category, and view detailed information using data from the [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
